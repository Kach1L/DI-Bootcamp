0. I think for the rock paper game I need to create a class called 'Rps'(Rock,Paper,scissors) which I will use for the text in each class that will be printed when the code is executed.

1. Since we are going to play against a computer, I think one of the steps would be to create self choice and computer choice parameters

2. We will need a play method that start all the other methods accordingly


0^2For the game file this is were the if statements and loops thats will make game function. Most likely I will only do for loops and try and except methods. 

1. We need to start a class for the backend part of the game.

2. We'll need a try method for when we ask rock, paper, scissors.
