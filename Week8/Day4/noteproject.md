## HTML/CSS

- section + button
- CSS align center

## JS

- event listener of click
- create a function that will fetch the data from this API
  https://www.swapi.tech/api/people/1
- need to find a random number between 1 and 83
- BONUS: to make sure that we don't receive twice in a row the same person
- create a function to display the element on the page (use the DOM)
- create another function that will fetch the data corresponding to the homeworld. If its not unknown then you fetch.
- if the person doesnt exist --> catch an error and show the error
- loader in the html is display none, we need to make it display block
  while we wait for the data to come back
